ChatSecure
=========

ChatSecure is an instant messaging client for iOS that integrates encrypted "Off the Record" messaging support from the [libotr](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/) library. It uses the [LibOrange](https://github.com/unixpickle/LibOrange) library to handle all of the AIM (OSCAR) functionality and the [XMPPFramework](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XMPPFramework/) to handle Jabber/GTalk (XMPP).


Cost
=========

This project is \***100% free**\* because it is important that all people around the world have unrestricted access to privacy tools.
However, developing and supporting this project is hard work and costs real money. Please help support the development of this project!
